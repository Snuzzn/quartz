In some cases, a sound judgment might be hard to identify. In particular, when we form habits, the judgments we produce feel as though they are not our own. This spell of familiarity can be broken with the aid of comparisons. 

We can try to find a similiar situation where person has a milder reaction to it than us. For example, going to the gym regularly is hard, but for other people, it is easy. So it's not going to the gym that's the problem, it's our own judgment. 

Conversely, we can find a similar situation where the person has a stronger reaction to it than us. For example, a very lazy person may stay in bed all day, because exercise is a torment to them.

This wide range of responses to the same things seem natural to the people involved. Similarly, our own response may seem natural or even inevitable, but since others clearly react differently, it is in fact up to the individual.
