A secondary goal of stoicism (in addition to attaining virtue) was introduced by the Romans: to **attain tranquility**, that is, a pyschological state marked by the absence of negative emotions like grief, anger and anxiety, and the presence of positive emotions like joy. Tranquility can *help us pursue virtue*. Someone who is not tranquil and is instead ruled by their negative emotions will have trouble reasoning well.
