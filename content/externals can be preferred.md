Although we should [[regard externals without attachment]], it is ok to have preferences about them e.g. preferring wealth than no wealth, or life without adversity. 

A preference is a desire to have one thing over another, without being too upset about the result either way. We can feel pleased or disappointment but we should remain tranquil.
