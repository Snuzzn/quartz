[[externals are not within our power|External]]s can be difficult to see accurately; they fool us. We should attempt to see things as they are. 

There are two techniques that can help with this:
- When an external presents itself, **add nothing**
	- do not tag it as good or bad news 
- If we are already aware of the external with its conventional meaning (whether desirable or undesirable), **subtract from it**
	- try to view it literally or break it down into parts that can be seen more clearly than the whole e.g. a fine salmon dish can be seen as a corpse of a fish
