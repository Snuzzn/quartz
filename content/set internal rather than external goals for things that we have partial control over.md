When considering things over which we partial control, we should avoid setting an external goal.

Let's use a game as as an example scenario. The goal we set for ourselves is to win the game. We have some control over this, since practice and effort can increase our chances but it doesn't guarantee a win. Thus, it can disrupt our tranquility.

However, if instead, we changed our external goal of winning the game to an internal goal of playing to the **best of our ability**, we have full control over this so we can guarantee achieving it. This will maintain our tranquility.
