People are [[externals are not within our power|external]]s. They can be difficult to see accurately.

We tend to judge them too quickly, 'measuring the pedestal along with the man'. We should ignore wealth, title, reputation, ethnicity, and instead look at their soul.

We can also apply the same to ourselves.
