Getting the thing we want tends not to produce the satisfaction we imagine, so we crave more. This is because the [[possession of a thing produces indifference]]. Thus, new desires replace the old desires as we get the thing.

It is clear then that the mind has an appetite for [[desire]] itself rather than any particular thing.
