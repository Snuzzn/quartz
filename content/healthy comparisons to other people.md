Healthy comparisons (those that don't cause discontent) to other people is a useful way of [[dealing with desire]]:

We can look to people from the past and present, and find examples who share similar experiences to us but don't suffer.

Furthermore, instead of looking to people who are doing better than us, we can instead look down and consider how many people are behind us. This helps reverse [[envy]].

Ideally, we would avoid comparisons at all, but it can pragmatically help with unwanted tendencies of the mind. So perhaps it is 'not good philosophy, but it is helpful psychology'.
