In [[stoicism]], virtue is the quality of character that allows us live well, and achieve [[eudaimonia]].

To live virtuously means to **reason well** (and make sound judgments). This in turn calls for certain qualities that we should exhibit.

The Stoics outline a taxonomy of virtue: dividing it into four cardinal virtues:
- **[[wisdom]]**
- **[[justice]]**
- **[[courage]]**
- **[[moderation]]**

By exercising these virtues, we express our human combination of rationality and sociability to take care of ourselves and others. Also, as we apply these virtues consistently, we give our lives an overall shape and wholeness.
