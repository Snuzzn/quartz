When we are insulted, we tend to form a judgment without much thought.
![[we react to judgments of events, not events themselves#^c0c726]]

We should instead try to [[choose judgments carefully through patient use of reason]].

In the above example, we can think upon the insult. Did the critic simply mean to degrade you? If so, that is their problem ([[externals are not within our power]]). 
If they meant well, we look at the criticism. If we are criticised justly, then we can accept it and change. If not, the critic is mistaken and deserves compassion for meaning well. 

The use of such reasoning can lead to a more appropriate judgment e.g. to not care about the insult or to accept the criticism. Either way, we won't react with anger.
