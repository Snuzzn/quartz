Emotions are reactions from judgments. 

For example, let's say we spot a rat next to our door. We feel curiosity and perhaps disgust (depending on our judgment). Then, we move closer and notice that it's just a stick that's fallen from a tree. That emotion of curiosity is instantly replaced by relief, and perhaps amusement at the illusion. 

Therefore, [[we don't need to actively change or repress our emotions]].
