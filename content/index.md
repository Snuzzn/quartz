title: Welcome to my Digital Garden

This is a freshly tilled space on the web, currently holding a selection of my notes on [[Stoicism]]. While this space only showcases a small portion of my notes currently, itâ€™s a living environment. Here, you'll find an ever-evolving collection of thoughts, reflections, and fragments of knowledge that grow and change with time, much like the living plants in a garden.
