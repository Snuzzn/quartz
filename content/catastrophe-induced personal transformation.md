We usually take a lot of things for granted. However, when a catestrophe occurs that causes great personal loss, we often come out appreciating many of those things that he had taken for granted. We become alerted to the beauty of the world.

For example, someone who comes close to dying may regain their zest for living. They may form stronger connections to the people around them. 

However, this kind of transformation has several drawbacks:
- catastrophes have terrible consequences, potentially life-threatening
- we can't rely on them to occur (and we probably don't want them to happen due to the previous point)
- the state of joy that a catastrophe grants will wear off over time

The stoic technique of [[negative visualisation]] offers the same benefit without the drawbacks.
