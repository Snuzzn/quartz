# Preface
- Stoicism involved many topics such as physics, including theories concering cosmology and theology
	- they saw nature as intelligent, and events express the will of a benevolent Providence
	- these ideas haven't stood the test of time as well as their insights about human nature 
	- so this book mostly focuses on the ethics and psychology aspects of stoicism
# Chapter 1 - Judgment
- We appear to go through life reacting directly to things in the world 
	- But this appearance is an illusion. We react to our judgments/opinions about the things not the things themselves. i.e. our experience of the world i.e. reactions, fears, desire etc. are not produced by the world but instead by our judgments
		- We're usually not aware of this
		- Sometimes, changing ourselves is more effective than trying to change the world
	- i.e. we are affected by our judgments about events not the events themselves ∴ we have more control on what we experience
	- “Events come to us through lenses of judgment that are so familiar we forget we have them on”
	- Stoics seek to become conscious of the judgements, to find the irrationality in them and choose them more carefully
	- Our way of reacting to anything depends on our beliefs, which are sometimes buried deep
		- But since these beliefs and judgments belong to us, we can change them by applying more rational scrutiny to them
	-  “Our experience of the world is our own doing, not the world’s doing, and the Stoic means to take responsibility for it.
- our reactions to events usually feel direct but there's a middle step
	- ~~event -> reaction~~
	- event -> judgement -> reaction to the judgement
	- stoics seek to notice the middle step, understand its frequent irrationality, and control it through the patient use of reason
		- this chapter about noticing; later chapters about irrationality and control
- example: insult
	- insult -> you care about the insult -> you dislike the person and feel anger
	- instead, you can decide to not care
	- if you get riled up, you are riled up by the judgment that it is bad and important 
- can be applied to all irritations e.g. noisy neighbour, bad weather, traffic jam
- same goes for bigger setbacks, for desires and fears
- Pain and pleasure seem like immovable facts that don't rely on our thinking but they are still influenced by our judgments about them
	- How much bother it casues, how much attention we pay, what it means to us - these are all judgments that we determine
	- pain discussed further in chapter 10
- There are different types of judgments
	- conscious opinion i.e. what we just say to ourselves vs. unconscious attitude i.e. ingrained and nonverbal
		- e.g. You believe that cockroaches aren't dangerous -> but you still feel fear because you have a conflicting ingrained, nonverbal judgement that rejects the cockroach
		- the former is easy to change, the latter is harder 
			- this is why stoicism is hard and why nobody can be perfect; sometimes we don't have the psychological strength to change an unconscious attitude (talked about in chapter 9)
			- however, stoicism doesn't call for all our unconscious attitudes to be changed but simply that we notice our judgments and reconsider our conscious opinions based on reason (many of our judgements aren't deeply rooted; they're just habits)
- If distress is caused by our judgments about things rather than the things themselves, we should try dropping these judgments and use new ones
	- judgements are our choice
	- can sometimes be difficult, and sometimes easy
		- but can be satisying and improves with practice
- In many situations where judgment should be reconsidered, it is simply a matter of re-examining our own sensitives using reason
	- e.g. chasing a fly away, dropping a key  - are these things really harming me?
- In other situations, the conclusion isn't so obvious, so the Stoics use comparisons
	- Stoics try to find situations where people face a similar thing to us but have a milder reaction to it 
		- e.g. some people are able to exercise strenuously every day and don't feel demotivated to do it; in fact, it's quite the opposite
		- e.g. some people endure the same pain more easily
		- eg. an injection is nothing compared to people who suffers gunshot wounds
	- We can also find situations where poeple face a simialr thing to us but it causes a stronger reaction, and so we realise it's just a matter of sensitivity that's up to us
		- e.g. to the lazy, exercise is a torment
	- What we are used to seeing others do, or ourselves do (habits), can make anything seem normal/strange or  inevitable/matter of choice.
		- once we take in a habit, the judgements feel like they're not our own
		- the spell of familarity must broken, and this is best done by looking at comparisons
- appetite is also a judgment

# Chapter 2 - Externals
- Chapter 2: about things that are not up to us
	- We attach ourselves to externals that we think we can control but we really can't and we deceive ourselves about them routinely, resulting in habits that make us unhappy and unfree
- We should reverse this: think more about the things up to us and think less about the things not up to us
- judgments are within our power and externals are not
- An external is something outside of power
	- examples in later chapters: moeny, fame, calamity,
- There are two stoic teachings about externals:
	1. regard externals without attachment
		- results in shift in the things that we spend energy on
			- stoics don't worry about things beyond their control
		- detachment also means not leting happiness depend on externals e.g. wealth, good opinion of others
			- we can still have preferences about externals e.g. preferring wealth than no wealth, preferring life without adversity
				- preference: want one thing more than other, but not being too upself by the result
					- having what you prefer is pleasing and not having it is a disappointment, but it's not a threat to your tranquility
				- attachment: happiness depends on the object of it.
					- it pushes and pulls you
					- distinction between happiness and preference discussed in later chapters
	2. we have a hard time seeing them accurately; they fool us
		- we should try to see things as they are
		- *Add nothing* when an external presents itself 
			- usually, when an event happens, we quickly tag it as good or bad news, then we react
		- If we are already aware of the externals which have conventional meanings (whether desirable or undesirable), *subtract* from it: view it literally or break it down into parts that we can see more clearly than the whole
			- e.g. when eating fancy food, see it literally/break it down: 'wine is the dribble of a bunch of grapes', 'corpse of a fruit'
- attachments to externals and/or treatment of externals as good/evil-> greed, dishonesty and excess
	- only thing that is good is the rightful use of reason
	- these externals are indifferent 
- attachment to externals can be considerd slavery
- other people are also externals
	- we can just as much trouble seeing them accurately as other externals
		- stoics advise to strip away their disguises
	- "beauty may be covered in filth...Conversely, evil... may be blocked by gleaming riches" - Seneca
	- we tend to judge people too quickly e.g. 'measuring the pedestal along with the man'
		- ignore titles, and wealth  -> look at their soul
		- we can also apply this to ourselves
- pay attention to difference between things we can control and things we can't 
	- some cases can be mixed: we may control over some aspects but not others
		- this can require hard analysis but the stoics don't spend too much time on it
- life can be can be considered a game. 
	- If we place our happiness in winning the game, it depends on causes outside of our power. 
	- If we placed our happiness in playing well, fairly, wisely and skillfully, we place it in our power
		- our happiness is secure and beyond the reach of fortune


# Chapter 5 - Desire
- most of our miseries are caused by desires/fears about the future, and pleasure/pain in the present
- event -> judgment -> desire/fear something
	- how do we know if the judgment is right?
- we often desire what we don't or can't have
- Desires tend to be insatiable
	- getting the thing tends not to produce the satisfaction we image
		- makes us want more; new desires replace desires once we get the thing
			- the mind has an appetite for desire rather than the item itself
- Desires can be natural or artifical
	- Natural desires are implanted by nature e.g. hunger
		- these are finite and can be fully satisfied
		- note that they still recur e.g. we get hungry every day
	- Artifical desires involves things aren't linked to a need, so don't have a natural stopping place e.g. status, reputation,
- When we work to fulfill a desire, we imagine the happinness that its attaintment will offer but the pursuit of a thing is more pleasant than the possession of it
	- possession of a thing and familiarity with it tends to produce indifference/disgust toward it 
		- anything loses its power to satisfy once it is possessed for two reasons:
			- we see it more realistically; possession exposes its importance
			- we adapt/become familiar with it
				- modern pscyhology calls it adaptation: tendency to become used to things and stop noticing them and all that from them
					- adaptation was seen in chapter1, when we get accustomed to a condition, making us feel that it is natural/inevitable
					- relevant again in chapter about adversity, where it is useful
				- adaptation corrodes ability to find pleasure in what we already have -> drives us to new desires
- We tend to mismeasure the value of what we have or don't have by comparing it to the expectations or holidngs of others 
	- this comparison lead to envy
		- there is alway someone else to be envious of: could be someone achievieng more or something else entirely
		- envy makes us desire things that we otherwise don't want
		- attaining that thing that others may or may not produce happiness, but we are definitely made unhappy by the envy itself i.e. the road to getting there
- we talk to ourselves about desires in ways that are constantly misleading
	- stoics offer advice to avoid/outwit the irrationalities:
		- try to see the desire accurately as an external and seek detachment from it
			- attachments are breeding ground for envy
		- instead of pursuing the desire (reaction), reconsider the judgment (middle step) using reasoning
		- make healthy comparisons (those that don't cause discontent) to other people
			- people and circumstances from the past
			- also from the present
				- we tend to look up (that's the nature of ambition) but instead, we can look down
					- consider how many more behind you than ahead of you
					- reverses envy
		- comparsion to loss
			- think instead about what we have (whether they are conditions e.g health, peace etc. or things e.g. relationships, items), and how much you would desire them if you lost it -> builds gratitude
			- adaptation: getting used to what we have -> we lose appreciation -> insatiable desires
			- stoics try to see old things freshly


# Chapter 5 - Wealth and Pleasure
- money and our fascination for it (greed) causes us misery
- attachment to wealth -> worry about losing it, anxious, feel pain when it is lost
- we overrate pleasures and underrate the cost of gaining them
1. stoics value moderation
	- it is not a compromise of pleasure
	- instead, it enhances pleasures
2. stoics also value detachment
	- learn to enjoy wealth and pleasure without grasping for them, holding too tightly when we have them, or being crushed when they are gone
3. Be happy with less - with enough
	- no difference between having something and not caring whether you have it
		- the second route is easier
- money is just like any other object of desire; having it doesn't satisfy your appetite for it and you desire more
- stoics believe that pleasure doesn't last long, always exacts a price and always alternates with some sort of pain


# Chapter 6 - What Others Think
- what others think:
	- approval e.g praise (good opinion of others) or fame (desire for status)
	- criticism e.g. insult or infamy
- stoics should have contempt for conformity to social expectation
	- i.e. don't look to others when thinking about preferences or how to act
	- this is difficult; most things people do are from convention
		- deviating results in swift punishment by others who conform
		- but conformity is an engine of misjudgment
			- we must resist this source of pressure
	- value things for their own sake - for their goodness rather than popularity
		- anything beuatiful is self-contained; it is not affected by the views of others
			- nothing is made better or worse by praise
- desire (appetite) for praise
	- this is a driver of conformity
	- instead of following popular judgments, have respect for our own opinions, and practise valuing things for what they are than what others think
	- stoics should have contempt for the judgment of others
		- look at the motivations and opinions of the people whose admiration who seek, and realise that they are flawed; so why seek admiration from them?
	- instead, replace it with greater respect for your judgments
		- this goes back to stoic emphasis on reasoning 
		- instead of seeking praise from others, praise yourself
- irrational dread of critcism and insult
	- don't fear the opinion of others; there is no end to that road
		- first, be comfortable neough with self-inflicted criticism that you are unconcerned when others add to it
			- try and accept the insult with a welcoming spirit
			- by rising aboving the insult, you are also rising above the antagonist
				- “the most humiliating kind of revenge is to treat your adversary as not worth taking revenge upon”
				- just like Shanks laughing off a drinked poured on his face; we should pick our battles
				- thorfinn - I have no enemies 
		- second, make an assessment of the criticism
			- if it just: accept it and change
			- if it is unjust: critic is mistaken and is entitled to compassion since they meant well, and acted in their best estmation
	- an effective insult requires a cooperation from the victim - a judgment that the insult matters; this judgment can be dropped or withheld
- didn't write notes on Fame
