Pain and pleasure may seem like immovable facts that don't depend on our thinking. However, they are still influenced by judgments. Thus, we can still [[choose judgments carefully through patient use of reason]].

Judgments include how much it bothers us and how much attention we pay, are our own to make. These judgements can affect the amount of pain and pleasure we feel.
