Judgments of events can be **conscious opinion** (what we say to ourselves) or **unconscious attitudes** (ingrained and nonverbal). 
- An example of a conscious opinion is that 'a dog is a threat to me'.  
- An example of an unconscious attitiude is an affinity for dogs.

It is possible that [[we can hold conflicting judgments about an event]]. These could be different types of judgments.


A conscious opinion is easier to change than an unconscious attitude. Changing an unconscious attitude usually requires a lot of pyschological strength. However, stoicism doesn't call for all our unconscious attitudes to be changed. 

Instead, we should try to notice our judgments and in particular, reconsider our conscious opinions based on reason.
