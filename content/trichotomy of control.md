Irvine and other stoics see a dichotomy/trichotomoy of control with the things we encounter in life. However, the [[trichotomy of control is misrepresented in Stoicism]].


The things we encounter in life can be categorised in three ways with respect to control:
- things we have no control over
- things that we have full control over
- things that we have partial control over (this is the most common one)

We should [[avoid focusing on things that we have no control over]]

We should instead [[focus on things that we have complete control over]], as they will guarantee results and require little time and energy.

Lastly, we should [[set internal rather than external goals for things that we have partial control over]]
