We can extend the [[negative visualisation]] technique by not just contemplating bad things happening, but actually undergoing voluntary discomfort periodically. 

Examples include taking a cold shower, underdressing for cold weather, going barefoot, going thirsty or hungry, sleeping on a hard surface etc.

By doing so, we prepare ourselves for misfortunes that may occur in the future. It also has two immediate effects:
- we gain confidence that we can withstand major discomforts, so those prospects won't cause us anxiety
	- in contrast, physical comfort in the present may cause mental discomfort for what the future holds
- we appreciate what we already have
	- e.g. we appreciate a warm room more when we go outside into the cold 


On the other hand, we should [[avoid pursuing short-term pleasure]].

Practising self-denial is not easy. It takes willpower, but it will get easier over time because [[willpower is like a muscle]]. Over time, stoics gain remarkable **courage** and **self-control**. They can do things that others dread, and refrain from things that others cannot resist.

- This is a [[stoicism|stoic]] technique
-  It should be noted that practising self-denial is not masochistic as the discomforts are quite minor and are not done to punish ourselves but to increase enjoyment of life.
