Our actions can have no effects on the past. Therefore, since we should [[avoid focusing on things that we have no control over]], we shouldn't worry about events that have happened in the past or wish it could have been different.

That's not to say that we should avoid thinking about the past altogether. We should still think upon past experiences to learn lessons that may help us in the future. But we shouldn't dwell on the past. 

For example, if a mother's child passes away after eating a poisonous berry, it is ok to grieve but she should not dwell on it as the past cannot be changed. She should also think about the past to take steps to keep her children away from poisonous berries. 

We should also [[let go of the present]].
