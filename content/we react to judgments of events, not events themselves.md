As we go through life, we appear to react directly to events. 
However, we're actually **reacting to the judgments about those events**, not the events themselves.

This can be summarised as follows:
event -> judgement -> reaction to the judgement

Here's a real-life example:
you are insulted -> you care about the insult -> you dislike the person and feel anger ^c0c726

Reactions like [[desire]] and [[emotions shadow your judgments]].

Since we constantly wear this lens of judgment, it is easy to forget that we have them on.

- Stoics advise that we should [[choose judgments carefully through patient use of reason]]
- There are various [[types of judgments]]
