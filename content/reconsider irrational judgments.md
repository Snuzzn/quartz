Although we aim to [[choose judgments carefully through patient use of reason]], we may notice in many cases that we've already formed a judgment. If this happens, we should become of aware of the judgment, find the irrationality in it and reconsider it.

In most cases, reconsidering our judgments is simply a matter of re-examining our sensitivies; we ask ourselves ''**Is this really harming me?**" e.g. when a fly buzzes around us.

In other cases, a sound judgment might be less obvious, so we might instead [[use comparisons to make sound judgments]]. 

The process of reconsidering our judgments can sometimes be difficult but it is satisfying to correct a judgment, and like most things, we improve over time.
