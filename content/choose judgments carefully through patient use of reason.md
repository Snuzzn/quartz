In our daily life, [[we react to judgments of events, not events themselves]]. As [[stoicism|stoic]]s, we should try to increase the gap between the event and judgement, wherein we use reason to form our judgment.

A common usecase is [[dealing with insults rationally]]. But reasoning can be applied to all manner of irritations such as a noisy neighbour, bad weather, heavy traffic, as well as greater setbacks. Even [[pain and pleasure are influenced by judgments]]. 

Often times, we form a judgment too quickly so we should [[reconsider irrational judgments]].

It can helpful when reasoning to keep in mind that [[externals are not within our power]].
