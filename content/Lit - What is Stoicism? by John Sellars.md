Stoicism has 3 parts: logic, ethics and physics. They form an integrated whole much like an egg (shell=logic, white=ethics yolk=physics), or human being (bones = logic, flesh = ethics, soul=physics).

# Logic
- broader than modern day definition
	- encompasses **knowledge** and logical consistency
- rationality is defining characteristic human being
	- so logical consistency is emphasised in stoicim and by most people in general
		- e.g. hypocrism is frowned upon by most people
- **judgments** are the foundation of all knowledge 
	- info is passed from senses and presented to the mind -> we make judgement (accept it or reject it) -> creates a belief
	- we make judgments on matters of fact but also value judgements, which shape our lives -> we pursue what we think is good and avoid what we think is bad; happy when we get the good stuff and frustrated when we don't
		- emotional lives the product of our judgment
	- > It’s not things that upset us but our judgements about things. _(_Epictetus, Handbook 5)
	- as stoics, we must pay attention to our judgments
		- we often make judgements too quickly and unthinkingly, almost unconsciously.
		- we should slow down and open up some distance between the momemt we experience something and making a judgment about it
			- e.g. accepting a strange news story, reacting angrily to an insult
			- > Don’t say more to yourself than first impressions report. You have been told that someone speaks ill of you. That’s what you’ve been told; you have not been told that you were harmed. _(_Marcus Aurelius, Meditations 8.49)

# Ethics
- encompasses **value**
	- what is good/bad and what we ought to do and not do
	- anything that's good will always benefit us
		- the only think that fits this category is an excellent character/state of mind
			- involves being rational, consistent, tranquil (not overcome by disruptive emotions), and possessing certain character traits: wisdom, courage, temperance, justice)
			- There are no situations where having a calm and rational mind will make things worse and likewise, no situations where being anxious and aggressive is going to make things better
			- e.g. if we think that a calm and rational frame of mind is what matters the most, then we will avoid judging that we've been harmed when we are insulted
- money, possessions, success and reputation are not considered 'good' but rather preferred indifferents
	- possessing them won't guarantee a good happy life e.g. many celebrities aren't happy

# Physics
- study of Nature; what exists
- stoics say that Nature is a single organic unity, an **interconnected** whole
	- we are parts of something larger than ourselves and our wellbeing is dependent on that larger thing
	- in addition, we are part of a a wider community both locally and of humankind
		- we depend on these communities: we don't grow our own food, make our own clothes, process our own sewage
	- conclusion: we can't survive alone; we rely on each other and on Nature
		- This should be taken into consideration in our choices
			- However, we don't need to decide between our interest and community/planet because they are the same


# Summary
- Three parts
	-   Logic: Judgements (determining our experience of the world)
	-   Ethics: Virtue (the one thing that always benefits us)
	-   Physics: Interconnectedness (we are parts of something larger than ourselves)
- Our goal is to be consistent
	- to live consistently (be rational)
	- to live consistently with Nature 
		- i)  human nature (be rational and social)
		- ii) Nature as a whole (be ecological/work with rather than against natural world)
	- to live consistently with what happens according to Nature (accept what happens to us that is not up to us, to embrace fate)
