We should focus on things that we have complete control over, as they will guarantee results and require little time and energy.

In Stoicism, these are generally considered as opinions, impulses, desires and aversions. 

However, Irvine believes that of these, we only have complete control over our opinions. This is in terms of the goals we set for ourselves (but not whether we achieve these goals) and our values e.g. on fame, fortune, pleasure, tranquility (but not whether we have live in accordance to these values)

We also have complete control over our character. We can cultive qualities like sincerity, dignity, industriousness, and sobriety.
