Stoicism is a philosophy of life which aims to seek [[eudaimonia]]. In order to do this, we should pursue [[virtue]].

Importantly, virtue should be pursued for its own sake, and in doing so, will give rise to joy and peace of mind as byproducts. ^77c57e

A foundational idea of stoicism is that [[judgments are within our power]] whereas as [[externals are not within our power]].

There are several techniques that stoics use in their daily lives:

- [[negative visualisation]]
- [[let go of the past]]
- [[self-denial]]
- [[meditate on daily life]]
