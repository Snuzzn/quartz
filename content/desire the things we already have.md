When we desire something we already have, we reverse the process of [[hedonic adaptation]]. We gain an **increased appreciation/gratitude** for that thing (such as a relationship or object), and we are able to get more joy from it.  

Furthermore, when we do eventually (and inevitably) lose it, though we may grieve, we can take solace in the fact that we appeciated it while it was with us.  If we had instead taken that thing for granted and not appreciated it, we would feel guilt.
