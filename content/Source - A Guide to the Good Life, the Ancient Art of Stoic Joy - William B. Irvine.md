## Part One - History of Philosophy
- Philosophy has likely always existed throughout history
	- people have always asked questions like 'Where did the world come from?' and "If it was God, who created God"
- Philosophical thinking took a huge leap forward in 6th centry BC
	- many individuals at around this time:
		- Pythagorus in Italy
		- Thales, Anaximander and Heracleitus in Greece
		- Confucius in China
		- Buddha in India
- In the 5th century BC, Socrates changed the focus of philosopcial thinking from what is now science (explaining the world and natural phenomena), to the human condition. 
	- He integrated theory and practical implementation into his lifestyle
	- Following his death, there was an explosion in interest in philosphy, whereby many different schools were formed, notably Platonism (which focuses on philosphical theory  and Cynicism (which focuses on living the good life)
- Zeno of Citium was the first Stoic
	- He first studied under many schools, notably the school of Cynicism and Platonism, combining the focus on lifestye of the former and the theory of the latter, like Socrates had done.
- Stoicisim abandoned the Cynic ascetism for a lifestyle that although was simple, allowed creature comforts
	- enjoy whatever good things become available, but at the same time, be prepared to give them up
- Zeno's stoicism had three components: logic, physics, ethics
	- logic: since man's distinguishing feature is rationality, it made sense to learn how to properly reason. 
		- students would become skilled at using logic to win arguments
	- physics: what we know as theology, it involves trying to explain things like existence, Gods, why we're here etc.
	- ethics: Stoic ethics was not about moral right and wrong but with living a good life
		- this is the most important component (especially in present day)
- what does it mean to live a good life? 
	- To be virtuous: to live as we were designed to live
		- e.g a virtuous hammer would be very good at its function, driving nails
		- for humans:
			- it is ability to reason that separates us from other animals. 
				- therefore, it can be concluded that we are designed to be reasonable
			- we are also social creatures 
				- therefore we have duties to fellow humans 
- Roman stoicism
	- When stoicism was introduced in Rome, there was less interest in logic and physics
	- Kept the ethical goal of **attaining virtue** but also had a second goal: to **attain tranquility **
		- tranquility is a pyschological state marked by the *absence of negative emotions* like grief, anger and anxiety, and the *presence of positive emotions* like joy.
	- The goals are connected: pursuing virtue gives us a degree of tranquility, which in turn makes it easier to purse virtue
	- since people (both the Romans and modern individuals) can immediately recognise the value of tranquility, it is the more important goal out of the two

## Part Two - Stoic techniques

### Negative visualisation
- We should periodically think about losing the things we value to:
	1. take action to prevent it from happening
	2. desire the things we have
		- this reverses the process of hedonic adaptation
			- tendency to quickly return to a base level of happiness despite positive or negative events
				- because humans are insatiable, when they work to achieve a desire and fulfill it, they adapt to its presence and then stop desiring it. 
			- hedonic adapation has the ability to snuff out our enjoyment of the world
			- we have almost certainly done this before, and as a result have adapted to many things, hence we must reverse this process by desire the things we already have	
		- as a result of desiring what we have, we will have *increased appreciation* for that thing e.g. relationship or objec, and gives us the ability to be more joyful
		- also, if we do eventually lose it (which is inevitable since all things are perishable), though we may grieve, we will be glad that we appreciated the time it was with us.
			- as opposed to guilt that we would experience if we had taken it for granted and not  appreciated it.
- One of the things we should contemplate losing is our own life
	- if we live each day as if it was our last, we will learn to appreciate the day and the joy of life
- In conclusion, negative visualisation helps embrace the life we happen to be living and extract every bit of joy from it, whilst preparing ourselves for change that will deprive ourselves of this joy
	- children are able to do this naturally, because they aren't sure whether the things they have today will disappear tomorrow.
	- but as we grow older and understand more about the world, we take things for granted, and not deprive ourselves the capacity for joy
	
### Dichotomy of control: on becoming invincible
- The dichotomy of control refers to the fact that some things are up to us while some things aren't up to us
	- Every thing we encounter in life should fall into one of these categories
	- We should only spend time on things thare in our control
- Most people choose to concern themselves with with things external to them rathern than internal
- In Stoicism, we give up the rewards the external world has to offer to gain tranquility
	- If we wish to seek contentment, we should change our desires rather than the world around us
		- Each desire should be something that you are certain is obtainable. 
			- Then you will never experience anxiety about desire fulfillment as you can never fail.
	- If we desire someting that is not up to us like the wellbeing of our family, it will disrupt our tranquility as we can't achieve it with certainty
		- if we don't achieve it, we will be upset but if we do acheive it, we experience anxiety in the process of achieiving it
- The dichotmoy of control may be false as there is ambiguity of what is up to us
	- there are things which we have no control over and things which we have some control over -> therefore, we have trichotomy of control
	- e.g.  we have some control over winning a game. Practice and effort can increase the chances but does not guarantee certainty. If we lose the game, we will be upset and our tranquility will be disturbed. However, this does not mean that a Stoic should refrain from playing the game (see the example later on)
- We should first focus on things that we have complete control over, as they wil guarantee results and require little time and eneregy
	- traditionally, these are optinions, impulses, desires and aversions
		- but Irvine believes that we have full control of over opinions and only partial control over the rest
			- if i experience a craving while on a diet, i have some control whether I act on this desire but no control over whether it arises
			- if i have an aversion to spiders, i have control over handling one (e.g. by sheer willpower), but I have no control over the fact that I don't like spiders
	- Irvine believes that we have complete control over opinions in terms of the gaols we set for ourselves (but not whether we achieve these goals) and our values e.g. on fame, fortune, pleasure, or tranquility (but not whether we have live in accordance to these values)
		- We also have control over our character. 
			- We can cultivate sincerity, dignity, industriousness, and sobriety. 
			- We can rise above pleasures and pains, stop lusting after popularity and control our temper.
- Most things in our life are things we have partial control
	- e.g. instead of our goal being to win the game (an external goal which we only have partial control over), our goal can be to  play to the best of our ability (an internal goal that we have complete control over). Our tranquility will then not be disturbed by the outcome.
		- Also, the internal goal can lead to better external performance (wanting to play to the best of our ability will improve our ability to win the game)
			- on the contrary, if we pursued the external goal, we might be less likely to acheive as we might flustered or anxious throughout the game
- In conclusion, we should keep a trichomtoy of control as we go about our daily lives. We short things into the 3 categories. The things which we have no control over are discarded. We instead concern ourselves with things we have partial or complete control over. For things we have partial control over, we should set internal rather than external goals.

### Fatalism - letting go of the past
- We have no control over the past or present, so we should not worry about events that happened
- We should not take a fatalistic attidue towards the future, that is, believing that our actions have no effect on future, and therefore not doing much to alter it
- When taking a fatalistic attitude towards the past, we should be aware that our actiosns can have no effect on the past.
	- therefore, we shouldn't spend time and energy and thinking about how the past may be different
	- it doesn't mean that we shouldn't think on the past. 
		- we should think about past experiences to learn lessons that can help us in the future
-  e.g. if a mother's child falls ill after eating a poisonous berry, she should try to seek treatment for the child, rather than let the poison take its natural course (if she was being fatalistic about the future)
	- however, if the child does pass away, she should adopt a fatalistic attitude towards the past and not dwell on it as the past cannot be changed.
		- note that it is ok to grieve.
		- she should also think about the past to take steps to keep her children away from poisonous berry
- We should also be fatalistic about the present
	- our actions cannot affect the present, as they will immediately become the past
	- we should not wish the current moment is different 
		- instead, we should be satisfied with life as it is and embrace the moment 
			- negative visualisation can help with this
		- this satisfaction with what we have does not mean that we should be complacent 
			- stoics should seek virtue, which involves doing our social duty
			- stoics should not seek fame or fortune
				- though many Stoics may gain fame anyway (chapter 14 and 15 will say how to deal with this predicament)


### Self-denial
- We can extend the technique of negative visualisation by not just contemplating bad things happening, but sometimes cause bad things to happen, and living through them
	- e.g. "practising poverty"
	- e.g. cold shower, underdressing for cold weather, going barefoot, go thirsty or hungry, sleep on a hard bed 
	- the key is we decided to do this harder thing even though the easier option is available
	- we can then better appreciate what we have
	- not masochism as the voluntary discomforts are quite minor and are done not to punish oneself but to increase enjoyment of life
- stoics welcome a degree of discomfort in their life
- three benefits
	- future: by choosing the harder option, we harden and prepare ourselves against misforuntes that might occur in the future. It's like a vaccine.
	- immediate: gain confidence that we can withstand major discomforts, so the prospect of experience major discomforts in the future will not cause anxiety
		- in contrast, someone who never gets cold or hungry, might dread the the possibility of someday going cold and hungry. 
			- i.e.  present physical comfort -> mental discomfort for what the future holds
	- immediate: appreciate what we already have. 
		- e.g. being in a warm room is nice but we can get a better appreciation for it if we go out into the cold for a while and then come back in
		- e.g. waiting until hungry before we eat a meal, or thirsty before we drink
- in addition to perioid acts of voluntary discomfort, Stoics periodically forgo opportunities to experience pleasure
	- pleasure has a dark side if pursued -> when captured, they become our captors
	- we should always abstain from pleasures that can capture us in a single encounter like drugs
	- ocassionaly abstain from relatively harmless pleasures like drinking alcohol not for the fear of being an alcoholic but just to practise self-control
	- if we are distracted from the pleasures of life, we are unlikely to be able to reason well
- this is not easy; it takes willpower
	- willpower is like a muscle, the more it is exercised, the stronger it gets
		- over time, stoics are able to develop remarkable courage and self-control
			- they can do things that others will dread and refrain from things that others cannot resist
- abstaining from pleasure can be pleasant
	- if we resist the urge to a eat a bowl of ice cream, we don't experience that gustatory pleasure but we do get the pleasure of having resisted
	- also, after a cost-benefit analysis, we will find that we can have more pleasure if we don;t eait in the longer term
