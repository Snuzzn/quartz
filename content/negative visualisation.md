We should periodically think about losing the things we value in order to:
- take action to prevent it from happening  (this is something that most people do)
- [[desire the things we already have]]


This helps us embrace the life we happen to be living and extract every bit of joy from it. At the same time, we are preparing ourselves for change that will deprive us of this joy. Otherwise, we risk considerable distress when things are taken from us.

An example of something we can contemplate losing is our own life. If we live each day as if it were our last, we learn to appreciate the day and the joy of life.
