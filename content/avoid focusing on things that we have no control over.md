We have no control over anything that occurs in the external world. 

If we desire something that is external like the wellbeing of our family or the outcome of a contest, it will disrupt our tranquility whether or not we achieve it. If we don't achieve it, we obviously get upset at our failure. If we achieve it, we often feel anxiety on the road to that outcome, or pressure to achieve it again.  ^af2171

In other words, we should not try to achieve things that we are not certain we can achieve.
