In life, [[we react to judgments of events, not events themselves]]. [[stoicism|Stoic]]s seek to [[choose judgments carefully through patient use of reason]]. 

There are two [[types of judgments]].

Since these judgments belong to us, they are within our power. In other words, our experience of the world - ours reactions, fears, desires etc. are our own, and we should take responsibility for it.
