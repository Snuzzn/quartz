An external is something outside of our power because it can be taken away. Common examples include money, fame, reputation and calamity. Also, [[people are externals]] and [[what others think]].

There are two key [[stoicism|Stoic]] teachings about externals:
- [[regard externals without attachment]]
-  [[unravel the disguise of externals]]

- Conversely, [[judgments are within our power]]
