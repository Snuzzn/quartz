A common misconception about stoics is that they are indifferent to positive and negative emotions such as joy or grief. This is the modern dictionary definition of a stoic. 

However, in reality, Stoics are optimistic about life and enjoy life's pleasures but are careful not to be enslaved by such pleasures. 

They also do not remove themselves from the world but work hard to make the world a better place.
