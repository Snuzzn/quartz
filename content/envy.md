Envy is a feeling of resentment when we [[desire]] things that others have. This happens when we compare what we have or don't have, to others.

Envy makes us desire things that we otherwise wouldn't want. 

Attainining the thing may or may not give us happinness. But we are definitely made unhappy by the feeling of envy itself, and therefore, the road to getting the thing.
