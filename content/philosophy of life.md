A philosophy of life consists of grand goal to living and a strategy to attain this goal. An example of such a philosophy is [[stoicism]].

Without a philosophy of life, there is danger that we will mislive, chasing after the pleasant day-to-day distractions that life offers without achieving anything valuable.
